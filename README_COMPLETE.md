## 📊 Your Dataset → ML Model

### Training Process
1. Loads CSV: `test/dataset/ceylon_trails_synthetic_v2.csv`
2. Feature engineering with cyclical time encoding
3. Trains RandomForest model (100 trees)
4. Saves to: `backend/model/itinerary_model.pkl`

### Features Used
- Group size, ages, mobility stats
- Terrain, accessibility, heat levels
- Time windows and preferences
- Cyclical time encoding (sin/cos)

### Output
- Suitability score (0-1)
- Recommended duration (minutes)
- Best time window
- Confidence metrics

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- **Port 5000 in use?** Edit `app.py` to change port
- **Model not found?** Run `python train_model.py` first
- **Dependencies missing?** `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Flutter Issues
- **GPS not working?** Check device permissions
- **API failing?** Ensure backend is running
- **Build errors?** Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

### Dataset Issues
- Ensure CSV is at: `test/dataset/ceylon_trails_synthetic_v2.csv`
- Check file format matches expected structure
- Verify all columns are present

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add more locations with real GPS coordinates
2. Implement multi-day trip support (already scaffolded)
3. Add offline mode for predictions
4. User accounts and saved trips
5. Social sharing features
6. Push notifications for weather alerts

---

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Start Backend First**: Always start the backend before running Flutter
2. **Check Permissions**: GPS requires location permissions
3. **Test Weather**: Weather API works offline after first call (cached)
4. **Try Meal Scheduling**: Toggle breakfast/lunch/dinner in trip settings
5. **Test AI**: Add group members with different mobility needs
